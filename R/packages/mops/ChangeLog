2014-04-02: Major revision of the package. The most important change is that
  the method modelError_multiDim no longer reads observation data from a file
  but expects them to be passed as a data frame (for better efficiency). Further
  changes were made to methods designed for operational updating.

2014-02-18: The package now checks whether the user's time zone in set to 'UTC'
  by means of the .onLoad function. Time zone specifications 'GMT' all changed
  to 'UTC'.

2013-12-26: Plotting has been outsourced from the 'mcs_eval' methods that
  analyzes the output of a Monte-Carlo simulation. This allows for the
  development of more flexible plotting methods.
  A bug in the documentation of the 'mcs_sample' method was corrected.

2013-08-21: The generation of parameter sets was moved to a separate function
  'mcs_sample'. This allows for the re-use of a particular parameter set in
  multiple MCS (which differ by other input data such as boundary conditions).

2013-07-31: The method 'mcs_eval' used to analyze the output of a Monte-Carlo
  simulation now generates two files: a .pdf file with graphics and a .txt file
  with results in numerical format.

2013-06-10: Major revision of the package with modification of many of the
  methods. Most important: The modelError_multiDim method no longer edits
  the model's input files automatically. The editing must now be performed
  by an external function. The user must make sure that this function is
  actually called inside modelError_multiDim.
  Furthermore: The Monte-Carlo method was re-worked completely. The actual
  simulation and the analysis of results are now in separate functions. This
  allows for a much more flexible use (because the results can be analyzed in
  different ways without the need for re-running the simulations).

2012-08-14: Changes in visEval to properly handle/plot missing observations.

2012-08-14: Changes in visEval to properly handle/plot missing observations.

2012-07-05: Improved documentation of methods.

2012-07-03: Bug fix. The time conversion functions were not properly passed in
  nested methods. The inner methods were always called with the defaults
  arguments because actual arguments were missing.

2012-06-11: The "GMT" time zone is now used in the default functions converting
  character representation of date/time to class POSIXct. This is to avoid
  problems with DST occuring when the system-specific defaults are used or the
  TZ environment variable does not specify a DST-free zone.
