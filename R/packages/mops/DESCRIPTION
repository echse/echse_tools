Description: The functions in this package facilitate the calibration of
    dynamic simulation models which read their input parameters from text
    files. In particular, the package provides functions which can serve as
    objective functions in one- and multi-dimensional optimization using R's
    standard methods like 'optimize' and 'optim'. It also provides support for
    Monte-Carlo simulation. The package has been developed in the context of
    hydrological catchment modeling.
